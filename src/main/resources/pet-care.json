        "description": "Dogs are domesticated descendants of wolves, known for their loyalty, social nature, and varied breeds offering a wide range of sizes, temperaments, and energy levels. They are often called 'man's best friend' due to their deep bond with humans. Dogs require significant time, attention, and training. They are not a low-maintenance pet and thrive on routine, exercise, and mental stimulation. Ownership is a long-term commitment that spans many years and encompasses everything from basic obedience to senior care.",
        "averageLifespan": {
          "range": "10 to 13 years",
          "details": "Lifespan varies dramatically by breed and size. Generally, smaller breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas, Toy Poodles) often live 15-17 years, while giant breeds (e.g., Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds) may only live 7-10 years. Mixed-breed dogs sometimes benefit from hybrid vigor and can have longer, healthier lives."

Non-core vaccines (e.g., Bordetella for kennel cough, Lyme disease) are recommended based on lifestyle and geographic location. Puppies require a series of shots, followed by boosters every 1-3 years throughout their lives.",

            "description": "Regular preventative care is the cornerstone of a dog's long-term health. This includes monthly treatments for fleas, ticks, and heartworm, which are parasitic infections that can cause severe illness or death. Intestinal deworming should also be performed regularly. An annual or bi-annual veterinary wellness exam is crucial for early detection of problems like dental disease, arthritis, or organ dysfunction.",

          "commonHealthIssues": {
            "description": "Dogs are prone to a variety of health issues, many of which are breed-specific. Common problems across many breeds include hip and elbow dysplasia (joint issues), allergies (food and environmental), skin infections, ear infections (especially in floppy-eared breeds), dental disease, and obesity. Purebred dogs often have genetic predispositions to certain conditions, such as brachycephalic syndrome in flat-faced breeds or heart conditions in larger breeds.",

        "climateAndEnvironment": {
          "heatSensitivity": {
            "description": "Dogs are highly susceptible to heatstroke because they primarily regulate their body temperature through panting and have limited sweat glands in their paw pads. Brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds like Bulldogs and Pugs are at extreme risk. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, drooling, bright red gums, lethargy, vomiting, and collapse. It is a medical emergency. Never leave a dog in a car on a warm day, even with windows cracked. Provide constant access to shade and fresh water during hot weather, and limit intense exercise to cooler parts of the day.",
            "bodyReaction": "In extreme heat, a dog's body can go into systemic failure. Panting becomes insufficient, body temperature skyrockets (often above 106°F / 41°C), leading to damage to the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys. This can be fatal within minutes."

          "coldSensitivity": {
            "description": "While some breeds with thick double coats (e.g., Huskies, Malamutes) are well-adapted to cold, many dogs are not. Short-haired, small, young, old, or sick dogs are particularly vulnerable to hypothermia. Signs include shivering, whining, anxiety, weakness, and slowed breathing. In cold climates, limit time outdoors, consider a dog coat or sweater, and wipe paws after walks to remove ice-melting chemicals, which can be toxic if licked.",
            "bodyReaction": "Prolonged exposure to cold forces the body to use energy to generate heat, leading to a drop in core body temperature. This slows metabolism, heart rate, and breathing. Severe hypothermia can cause unconsciousness and cardiac arrest."

        },
        "soundSensitivity": {
          "description": "Dogs have exceptionally sensitive hearing, capable of detecting frequencies far beyond the human range. This makes them vulnerable to noise anxiety. Common triggers include thunderstorms, fireworks, construction noises, and even household appliances like vacuum cleaners. The fear response can range from mild trembling and hiding to destructive behavior, attempts to escape, and self-injury. This is a serious welfare issue that often requires behavioral training and, in some cases, medication prescribed by a veterinarian.",

Regular brushing is essential to remove loose fur, prevent mats, distribute skin oils, and reduce the amount of hair in the home.

Daily tooth brushing with dog-specific toothpaste is the gold standard. Dental chews, water additives, and special diets can provide supplemental benefits.",
